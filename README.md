# mini-prolog
*a mini prolog interpreter on python*<br/>

I used backword chaining in this porgram. It could save space in memory, but it took longer time compared with forward chaining.<br/>
However, for any knowledge base smaller than 10k sentances (rules and facts), it should complete in less than 10 seconds.
